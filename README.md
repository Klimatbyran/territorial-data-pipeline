# Territorial Climate Data Pipeline

## General information

### Getting started

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies. If you're using Python 3, you can replace `pip` with `pip3`.

### Example calculation

A Google Doc with example calculations for the emissions in Skövde municipality can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MihysUkfunbV0LjwSUCiGSqWQSo5U03K0RMbRsVBL7U/edit#heading=h.oqnz3ereclbn). The calculations for each step are described in words (in Swedish) and, where possible, an explicit and simple calculation is presented. NOTE: The document is intended as method desciption for non-coders and people that are new to the source code. The document is open and editable and may therefore be updated over time.

### Data Sources

We obtain our information from multiple providers including SMHI, SCB, Trafa, and PowerCircle. Some of this information is stored directly in our repository, while other datasets are dynamically pulled from their original locations.

### Data Transformation

We utilize Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to perform various calculations on the collected data. This allows us to tailor the data into a format that is easier to understand and display on our website.

### Repository Structure

This repository contains both the datasets we host and the Python scripts for calculations.
 - `climate_data_calculations.py`: Execute this Python script to run all the calculations and generate updated data.
- `/output:` This is where the processed data gets saved.
    - `municipality-data.json`: This JSON file contains the calculated climate data for individual municipalities.
    - `regional-data.json`: This JSON file contains climate data aggregated at the county (Swedish "län") level, including emissions, trends, Carbon Law calculations, and Paris Agreement compliance metrics for each region.
    - `national-data.json`: This JSON file contains climate data aggregated at the national level for Sweden, including emissions, trends, Carbon Law calculations, and Paris Agreement compliance metrics.
    - `municipality-sector-emissions.json`: This JSON file contains emissions data broken down by sector (e.g., transportation, industry, agriculture) for each municipality.
    - `region-sector-emissions.json`: This JSON file contains emissions data broken down by sector for each region (Swedish "län").
    - `national-sector-emissions.json`: This JSON file contains emissions data broken down by sector for Sweden at the national level.
- `/facts:` Contains reference data files used by the pipeline.
    - `municipalities_coat_of_arms.csv`: Coat of arms image URLs for all municipalities (updated via `update_coat_of_arms.py`).
    - `regions_coat_of_arms.csv`: Coat of arms image URLs for all regions (updated via `update_coat_of_arms.py`).
- `/tests:` Unit tests for data calculations. To run all tests:

    ```
    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
    ```

    To run a specific test file:

    ```
    python3 -m unittest tests/{filename}.py
    ```

    where you replace *filename* with the name of the actual test file.
    
    If you notice any test failing, please submit a ticket about it.

### Performance profiling

Requires Graphwiz installed on the OS https://www.graphviz.org/download/
```sh
py.test tests --profile-svg && open prof/combined.svg
```

### How to Update Data on Site

To recalculate and refresh the site's data, start by executing:

`python3 climate_data_calculations.py`

This generates the main municipality data file (`municipality-data.json`).

Then run:

`python3 sector_emissions.py`

This generates sector-specific emissions data for municipalities (`municipality-sector-emissions.json`).

Then run:

`python3 generate_regional_data.py`

This generates regional (county-level) aggregated data (`regional-data.json`).

Then run:

`python3 sector_emissions.py --regions`

This generates regional sector-specific emissions data (`region-sector-emissions.json`).

Then run:

`python3 generate_national_data.py`

This generates national-level aggregated data (`national-data.json`).

Finally, run:

`python3 sector_emissions.py --national`

This generates national sector-specific emissions data (`national-sector-emissions.json`).

The results will be saved in the `/output` folder in their respective JSON files.

### Coat of Arms Data

The pipeline uses coat of arms images for municipalities and regions. These are stored in CSV files for fast access:

- `facts/municipalities_coat_of_arms.csv`: Contains coat of arms URLs for all municipalities
- `facts/regions_coat_of_arms.csv`: Contains coat of arms URLs for all regions (Swedish "län")

**Updating Coat of Arms Data:**

To update the coat of arms data from Wikidata, run:

`python3 update_coat_of_arms.py`

This script queries Wikidata for coat of arms images and updates both CSV files. The script:
- Searches Wikidata for each municipality and region
- Retrieves coat of arms image URLs from Wikidata properties (P94, P154, or P18)
- Saves the results to the respective CSV files

**Using Coat of Arms in Pipelines:**

The pipeline scripts use CSV-based functions (`get_coat_of_arms_from_csv` and `get_region_coat_of_arms_from_csv`) instead of querying Wikidata directly. The CSV files are automatically read by the pipeline scripts when generating municipality and regional data.

Since coat of arms are seldom (never) changed, this approach allows the pipelines to run much faster than if Wikidata is queried at every run.


#### Handling Data Inconsistencies for Municipalities

Given that Klimatkollen focuses on data related to municipalities, it's often necessary to standardize the naming conventions for Swedish municipalities as they can vary across different datasets. The following are known cases:

- Falun: also called Falu kommun.
- Gotland: also called Region Gotland or Region Gotland (kommun).
- Upplands Väsby: alternate spelling includes Upplands-Väsby.
- Stockholm: also called Stockholms stad.
- Malmö: also called Malmö stad.

In the list, the term appearing before the colon (:) is the standardized name that we use in the repository. Any alternative names listed after "also known as" should be converted to this standard version when incorporating new data sets.

## Detailed explanations

### Emission Calculations 

The folder `/kpis/emissions` contains files with functions to perform calculations related to CO2 emissions for municipalities, based on SMHI emission data and Carbon Law. Each function serves a specific purpose such as preprocessing data or future trends. Their order of execution is specified in `/kpis/emissions/emission_data_calculations.py`.

#### Constants 

There are a few important constants that determine the source, baseline and scope of the calculations.

* `PATH_SMHI`: API URL to the SMHI emissions data from the [National Emission Database](https://nationellaemissionsdatabasen.smhi.se/). Currently set to download data for all municipalities and counties with GGT (Greenhouse Gas Total) emissions.
* `CARBON_LAW_REDUCTION_RATE`: SAnnual reduction rate mandated by the Carbon Law, currently set to 11.72% per year (0.1172 as decimal) as of 2025.
* `LAST_YEAR_WITH_SMHI_DATA`: The last year for which verified emissions data is available from SMHI's National Emission Database.
* `CURRENT_YEAR`: The year to be treated as the current year for calculations and projections (currently 2025).
* `END_YEAR`: The final year for emission projections and Carbon Law calculations (currently 2050).

#### Functions

Here's a summary of what the functions do, in order of execution in `/kpis/emissions/emission_data_calculations.py`:

1. `get_n_prep_data_from_smhi`: Downloads data from SMHI and preprocess it into a pandas dataframe.

2. `calculate_trend`: Calculates linear trend coefficients and future values for each municipailty based on SMHI data from 2015 and 2020 onwards. This is done by fitting a straight line to the data using least absolute deviations (LAD).

3. `calculate_approximated_historical`: Calculates approximated historical data values for years passed since the last year with SMHI data. This is done by interpolation using previously calculated linear trend coefficients.

4. `calculate_trend`: Calculates trend line for future years up to 2050. This is done by interpolation using previously calculated linear trend coefficients

5. `calculate_historical_change_percent`: Calculates the average historical yearly emission change in percent based on SMHI data from 2015 onwards.

6. `calculate_carbon_law_total`: Calculates total emissions from carbon law reduction path for municipalities.

### Regional Data

The `generate_regional_data.py` script aggregates municipality-level climate data to the county (Län) level. Regional data includes:

- **Historical emissions**: Year-by-year emissions data for each county from 1990 onwards
- **Total trend**: Sum of projected emissions from the current year to 2050 based on linear trend analysis
- **Total Carbon Law**: Total emissions allowed under the Carbon Law reduction path (11.72% annual reduction)
- **Approximated historical emissions**: Interpolated emissions for years between the last verified SMHI data and the current year
- **Trend projections**: Projected emissions for each year from the current year to 2050 based on historical trends
- **Historical emission change percent**: Average annual percentage change in emissions since 2015
- **Paris Agreement compliance**: Boolean indicating whether the region's projected emissions meet the Carbon Law requirements (meetsParis)
- **Municipalities**: List of municipalities included in each county

Regional data uses the same calculation methods as municipality data but aggregates results at the county level, making it useful for regional analysis and comparisons.

### National Data

The `generate_national_data.py` script aggregates municipality-level climate data to the national level for Sweden. National data includes:

- **Historical emissions**: Year-by-year emissions data for Sweden from 1990 onwards
- **Total trend**: Sum of projected emissions from the current year to 2050 based on linear trend analysis
- **Total Carbon Law**: Total emissions allowed under the Carbon Law reduction path (11.72% annual reduction)
- **Approximated historical emissions**: Interpolated emissions for years between the last verified SMHI data and the current year
- **Trend projections**: Projected emissions for each year from the current year to 2050 based on historical trends
- **Historical emission change percent**: Average annual percentage change in emissions since 2015
- **Paris Agreement compliance**: Boolean indicating whether Sweden's projected emissions meet the Carbon Law requirements (meetsParis)
- **Municipalities**: List of all municipalities included in the national aggregation

National data uses the same calculation methods as municipality and regional data but aggregates results at the national level, providing a comprehensive view of Sweden's overall climate performance.

### Sector Emissions Data

The `sector_emissions.py` script extracts and processes sector-specific emissions data from SMHI's National Emission Database on municipal level. Sector emissions data includes:

- **Municipality-level breakdown**: Emissions data organized by municipality name
- **Sector categories**: Emissions broken down by main sectors such as:
  - Transportation
  - Industry
  - Agriculture
  - Energy production
  - Waste management
  - And other sectors as defined in SMHI's database
- **Yearly data**: Sector emissions provided for each year available in the SMHI dataset
- **Structured format**: Data organized as `{municipality: {year: {sector: emissions}}}` for easy access and visualization

This data enables analysis of which sectors contribute most to emissions in each municipality, helping identify areas for targeted climate action.

### Regional Sector Emissions Data

The `sector_emissions.py` script also includes functions to extract and process sector-specific emissions data at the regional level. Regional sector emissions data includes:

- **Region-level breakdown**: Emissions data organized by region name
- **Sector categories**: Emissions broken down by main sectors such as:
  - Transportation
  - Industry
  - Agriculture
  - Energy production
  - Waste management
  - And other sectors as defined in SMHI's database
- **Yearly data**: Sector emissions provided for each year available in the SMHI dataset
- **Structured format**: Data organized as `{region: {year: {sector: emissions}}}` for easy access and visualization

This data enables analysis of which sectors contribute most to emissions in each region, helping identify areas for targeted climate action at the regional level.

### National Sector Emissions Data

The `sector_emissions.py` script also includes functions to extract and process sector-specific emissions data at the national level. National sector emissions data includes:

- **National-level breakdown**: Emissions data for Sweden as a whole
- **Sector categories**: Emissions broken down by main sectors such as:
  - Transportation
  - Industry
  - Agriculture
  - Energy production
  - Waste management
  - And other sectors as defined in SMHI's database
- **Yearly data**: Sector emissions provided for each year available in the SMHI dataset
- **Structured format**: Data organized as `{country: {year: {sector: emissions}}}` for easy access and visualization

This data enables analysis of which sectors contribute most to emissions at the national level, providing a comprehensive view of Sweden's sectoral emissions profile.
